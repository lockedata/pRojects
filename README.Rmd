This package is designed to take away some grunt work around setting up new projects.

All projects get setup with Git, GitHub and Travis by default.

- Use `create_package_project()` to setup a project with code coverage, vignettes, unit testing etc. out of the box

- Use `create_analysis_project()` to get a project ready for a typical analysis project. It includes [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to help with reproducibility.

- Use `create_training_project()` to get a project ready for delivering training that often involves handouts and presentation materials. It includes [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to help with reproducibility.

All functions implement name validation based on the guidance in ["Writing R Extensions"](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file), "[The name] should contain only (ASCII) letters, numbers and dot, have at least two characters and start with a letter and not end in a dot".

## Setup for `starters`

### Installation

```
remotes::install_github("lockedata/starters")
```

### `start_here()` function

Run

```r
starters::start_here()
```

This function checks different aspects of your setup (git installation, gitconfig, `GITHUB_PAT`, `DESCRIPTION` default values, GitHub username guessing), that will help automatic steps later on. Most of these aspects are inspired from [`usethis` setup article](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html). For each aspect, if your setup needs improvements an informative error message will be thrown so you might be able to know how to proceed.

## RStudio gadget
If you want to set up a project without using the R functions, [\@jonmcalder](https://github.com/jonmcalder) made a nifty [RStudio addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/). Install the package to get it added to your RStudio instance.
