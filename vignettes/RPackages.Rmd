The function `createPackageProject()` aims to facilitate your package development by setting up a best practices template project.

## Setup
The package projects get a basic R package structure, i.e. a DESCRIPTION file and an `R/` directory, but by default a number of [`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/) functions are called to setup what we consider to be best practices.

Best practices include:

- Using [`testthat`](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html) to unit test your code
- Using [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for testing your package in a clean environment
- Using a code coverage platform to check how much of your code is tested by unit tests
- Licensing the package under MIT 
- Creating package documentation (README, a vignette, a package doc, and a NEWS file)
- Using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) source control
- Developing the package subject to a Code of Conduct 


UPDATE

## Make your own
You could either make a wrapper around `createPackageProject()` to add additional setup steps, or you could make an alternative version of the function.

If you make your own, we'd be interested to hear about what you change/add and why. Please let us know on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lockedata/starters/issues).
